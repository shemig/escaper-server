You're an expert and helpful programmer, with a lot of experience with setting up low level code and Internet of Things style applications.

I would like help in setting up a simple server applications, managing signals from devices used as different stations in an escape room.

The server needs to communicate with the different sensors, apply some logic and trigger other events. For example, receiving some event notifications, and sounds a specific sound clip on another device/channel.

The server communicates with the different stations using MQTT.

It needs to support the overall state of the entire "Escape Room Session".

I would like to start with a simple server, listening on MQTT notifications, and playing available audio clip given some logic.

The server should be efficient in terms of memory usage and runtime.

It should be preferably implemented in python, and maybe some shell script if necessary.

Assume unix-family type of shells. I should be able to run it on WSL in windows.

The server should also be dockerized to it will be easy to deploy (with minimal configuration).

Before proceeding with code generation \- ask me any clarifying questions you may have.

Make sure you understand the requirements and any boundary conditions. 

Excellent, thank you for the detailed answers\! That clarifies things significantly.

Here's a summary of my understanding based on your input, and a couple of final checks before outlining the plan and then proceeding to code generation upon your approval:

**Summary of Understanding:**

1. **Setup:** We will create a complete setup from scratch, including an MQTT broker (Mosquitto) and the Python server application, all managed within Docker containers using docker-compose.  
2. **MQTT Topics:**  
   * **Incoming Events:** escaperoom/station/\<station\_id\>/event/\<event\_type\> (e.g., escaperoom/station/5/event/beacon\_proximity).  
   * **Server Control:** escaperoom/server/control/session (e.g., for messages like {"action": "start"}).  
   * **Outgoing Commands:** Initially none, as audio is local. Structure reserved for future use.  
3. **Message Format:** JSON (e.g., {"sensor": "beacon\_proximity\_1", "station\_id": "5", "range": 3}).  
4. **Audio Playback:** The Python server application itself will play audio files locally on the machine running the Docker container (Option A). The playback logic will be modular. Audio files will be included within the Docker image.  
5. **Logic & Configuration:** Logic rules (like the beacon proximity example) will be defined in an external configuration file. This file will specify the triggering conditions (topic, message content checks, thresholds) and the corresponding action (e.g., play a specific sound file).  
6. **State Management:** The server will maintain the overall session state (PENDING, RUNNING, etc.) and the completion status of individual stations in memory. State will be reset if the server restarts. Session start/stop will be triggered by specific MQTT messages.  
7. **Runtime Environment:** Standard laptop/desktop performance is sufficient. Docker on a Unix-like system (including WSL) is the target.  
8. **Operation:** The server will be runnable from the command line and log output to both the console (stdout) and a dedicated log file.

**Final Checks:**

1. **Audio Library:** For local audio playback (Option A), I propose using the playsound Python library. It's simple and generally cross-platform. However, it might require installing underlying system audio libraries (like gstreamer or mpg123 on Linux/WSL) within the Docker container. Is this acceptable? Alternatives like pygame exist but might be slightly heavier.  
2. **Configuration File Format:** For the configuration file defining rules, thresholds, etc., I suggest using YAML (.yaml) as it's often more human-readable than JSON for configuration. Would YAML be suitable?  
3. **State Persistence:** Just to be absolutely clear, for this initial version, the state (session status, station completion) will reside only in the server's memory. If the Docker container restarts, the state will be lost and reset. Is this acceptable for the starting point?

Everything seems clear from my side based on your answers. Once you confirm these last few points (or provide alternatives), I'm ready to outline the project structure and proceed when you give the green light\!

Okay, thank you for the clarifications\! This makes the initial implementation simpler in some ways.

Let's refine the plan based on your latest points:

**Revised Plan Summary:**

1. **Setup:** Same as before (Mosquitto \+ Python Server in Docker via docker-compose).  
2. **MQTT Topics & Message Format:** Unchanged (JSON messages on topics like escaperoom/station/\<station\_id\>/event/\<event\_type\> and escaperoom/server/control/session).  
3. **Audio Playback:** Unchanged (Local playback using a simple library like playsound, audio files inside the Docker image, modular code).  
4. **Logic:** The core logic (e.g., "IF event X from station Y occurs AND condition Z is met THEN do action A") will be **hardcoded directly within the Python server script (server.py)**.  
5. **Configuration:** Specific *parameters* used by the hardcoded logic (like station IDs, sensor names, range thresholds, specific sound file names to play for certain events) will be read from an external **config.json** file. This keeps values easily tweakable without changing the Python code itself.  
6. **State Management:**  
   * State (session status, station completion) will be kept **in memory** for this version.  
   * The code structure will be designed keeping **future file-based persistence** in mind, making it easier to add saving/loading state to a local file later if needed. We won't implement the saving/loading *now*, but the design will accommodate it.  
7. **Runtime & Operation:** Unchanged (Standard hardware, Docker on Unix/WSL, CLI runnable, logging to stdout and file).

**Example Configuration (config.json) Structure:**

Based on this, the config.json might look something like this:

JSON

{  
  "mqtt\_broker": {  
    "host": "mqtt\_broker",  
    "port": 1883  
  },  
  "audio\_base\_path": "/app/audio/",  
  "log\_file": "/app/logs/server.log",  
  "station\_configs": {  
    "5": {  
      "beacon\_proximity\_1": {  
        "range\_threshold": 5,  
        "sound\_on\_trigger": "nearby\_alert.wav"  
      }  
    },  
    "door\_sensor": {  
       "main\_door\_switch": {  
         "sound\_on\_open": "door\_open\_sound.wav"  
       }  
    }  
    // ... other station/sensor specific parameters  
  }  
}

The Python code would then load this file and use config\['station\_configs'\]\['5'\]\['beacon\_proximity\_1'\]\['range\_threshold'\] within its hardcoded logic for station 5's beacon.

This revised plan seems to match your requirements accurately now.

Is this understanding correct? If yes, I can proceed with outlining the project structure and then generating the initial code and configuration files.
